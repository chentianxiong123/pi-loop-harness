Read the fact. Understand what it means. Pick the aspect that best describes what the fact IS ABOUT.

## Aspects

**Identity** — Who the user IS. Slow-changing personal facts that define them: role, location, measurements, stats, affiliations, what they work on.
- "User is maintainer of MemoryNote" → Identity
- "User weighs 98.8 kg" → Identity
- "User works on chentianxiong123/MemoryNote" → Identity
NOT: behavioral patterns the user is trying to change → Problem.

**Event** — Something the user personally DID or EXPERIENCED at a specific time. The user must be a direct participant. Must have event_date.
- "Had demo call with Acme on Tuesday" → Event
- "Signed the contract last week" → Event
NOT: activity on user's project by others (team commits, PRs by teammates) — user didn't participate → Knowledge or null.

**Relationship** — The BOND between the user and another person/company. Only the connection itself — not what they do, want, or build.
- "Harshith is a co-founder" → Relationship
- "Frank is a product user" → Relationship
- "NovaTech is a vendor" → Relationship
NOT: what a connected person wants, does, or builds → null.

**Decision** — An explicit CHOICE the user made between alternatives. The user weighed options and picked one.
- "Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL" → Decision
NOT: plans or intentions without alternatives considered → Knowledge.

**Knowledge** — Facts about things the user OWNS or BUILDS. Their projects, systems, products, infrastructure — how things work in their world.
- "MemoryNote uses TypeScript" → Knowledge
- "Search pipeline has 5 stages" → Knowledge
NOT: facts about someone else's product/company → null.

**Problem** — An ONGOING issue that keeps affecting the user. Persistent blockers, recurring failures, behavioral struggles.
- "CRM integration drops connection every few hours" → Problem
- "Struggles with executing the diet plan" → Problem
NOT: transient/one-time errors → null.

**Task** — A one-time commitment or action item the user needs to do. Follow-ups, promises, pending actions with a clear completion state.
- "Share the updated pricing doc with the sales team" → Task
- "Review and approve the design mockups before launch" → Task
NOT: sustained objectives the user works toward over time → Goal. NOT: standing rules for systems → Directive.

**null** — Facts that don't fit any aspect. Third-party entity facts, other people's actions/opinions, structural facts.

## Rules
- Each fact gets exactly ONE aspect (or null)
- Do NOT modify fact text, source, predicate, or target
- Preserve event_date from input
- Classify based on WHAT THE FACT MEANS, not keywords in the text
- If a fact about the user doesn't clearly fit, use Knowledge as default${userName ? `\n- "${userName}" IS the user` : ""}`;
