Transform this content into enriched, information-dense statements that capture complete context for knowledge graph storage.

CRITICAL: CAPTURE ALL DISTINCT PIECES OF INFORMATION. Every separate fact, preference, request, clarification, specification, or detail mentioned must be preserved in your enriched output. Missing information is unacceptable.

OUTPUT GUIDELINES:
- Simple content (1-2 facts): Use 1-2 concise sentences
- Complex content (multiple facts/categories): Use multiple focused paragraphs, each covering ONE topic area
- Technical content: Preserve specifications, commands, paths, version numbers, configurations
- Let content complexity determine output length - completeness over arbitrary brevity
- IMPORTANT: Break complex content into digestible paragraphs with natural sentence boundaries for easier fact extraction

<speaker_role_awareness>
CRITICAL: Episodes may contain MULTIPLE speakers with DIFFERENT fact authority:

USER STATEMENTS → Can become user facts:
- Direct statements: "I want X", "My goal is Y", "I prefer Z", "I decided to..."
- Confirmations: "Yes", "Do that", "Let's go with X", "Sounds good, proceed"
- Instructions/directives: "Don't show me X", "Always do Y", "Never remind me about Z"
- Reports: "I completed X", "I ate Y", "I met with Z"

ASSISTANT STATEMENTS → Generally NOT user facts:
- Suggestions: "You could try X", "I recommend Y", "Here's an option..."
- Questions: "Want me to do X?", "Should I proceed?", "Would you like..."
- Explanations: "This works because...", "The reason is..."
- Coaching/guidance: "Here's how to do X...", "Best practice is..."
- Information provided: "I found X", "The data shows Y"

CRITICAL RULES:
1. User statements → Normalize as user facts, preferences, decisions, actions
2. User confirms assistant suggestion → Normalize as user decision (e.g., "User decided to X after assistant recommendation")
3. Assistant offers/asks WITHOUT user response → DO NOT attribute to user. Instead: "The assistant offered to X" or "The assistant suggested Y"
4. Assistant provides information → Attribute to assistant: "The assistant provided X" or "The assistant explained Y"
5. User silence ≠ user agreement. No response to an offer means the offer is pending, not accepted.

DETECTING CONFIRMATIONS:
Look for user responses like: "yes", "yeah", "do it", "go ahead", "sounds good", "let's do that", "proceed", "ok do it", "sure", "please do"
These convert assistant suggestions into user decisions.

DETECTING REJECTIONS/DISMISSALS:
When user dismisses or rejects an assistant's task/suggestion (e.g., "ignore", "skip", "don't bother", "never mind", "no", "not now"), normalize the user's INTENT about the UNDERLYING TASK, not the act of dismissing the message.
- Use session context to identify what task/topic the user is rejecting
- "ignore" (after assistant offered to check a security PR) → "User instructed to ignore the security PR"
- NOT: "User instructed to ignore the assistant's prior message"
- "skip" (after assistant proposed reviewing error logs) → "User declined to review the error logs"
- NOT: "User told the assistant to skip its suggestion"

MULTI-PARTY CONTENT (email threads, forwarded messages, group chats, shared conversations):
Episodes may contain content from people BEYOND the user and assistant — email senders, CC'd recipients, forwarded messages, quoted replies. These are FIRST-CLASS content, not background noise.

Rules for multi-party content:
1. Each person's statements are facts ABOUT that person and their relationship to the user — preserve them with clear speaker attribution
2. Quoted/forwarded/nested content contains real information — extract it the same as direct content
3. Contact information in signatures (email, phone, company, role, address) are entity attributes — preserve them
4. The conversation THREAD tells a story — preserve the sequence of who said what and when
5. Deduplicate repeated content (same signature appearing 3 times) — capture once, not three times
</speaker_role_awareness>

<enrichment_strategy>
1. PRIMARY FACTS - Always preserve ALL core information, specifications, and details
2. SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION - Maintain clear distinction between what user said vs what assistant said
   - For self-introductions ("I'm X", "My name is Y"), preserve as "the user introduced themselves as X"
   - For assistant statements, preserve as "the assistant suggested/explained/provided X"
3. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION - Convert relative dates to absolute dates using timestamp
4. CONTEXT ENRICHMENT - Add context when it clarifies unclear references
5. SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT - Include semantic synonyms and related concepts to improve search recall (e.g., "address" → "residential location", "phone" → "contact number", "job" → "position/role/employment")
6. ATTRIBUTE ABSTRACTION - For personal attributes (preferences, habits, contact info, practices):
   - Replace pronouns with actual person names from context
   - Frame as direct "[Person] [verb] [attribute]" statements (NOT "[Person]'s [attribute] is/are X")
   - Break multiple preferences into separate sentences for atomic fact extraction
   - Examples:
     * "I prefer dark mode" → "John prefers dark mode"
     * "Call me at 555-1234" → "Sarah's phone number is 555-1234"
     * "I avoid creating files" → "John avoids creating new files unless necessary"
     * "My manager is Alex" → "Mike is managed by Alex"
     * "I prefer X, Y, and avoid Z" → "John prefers X. John prefers Y. John avoids Z."
   - IMPORTANT: When the user describes a product, project, or system, keep the product/project as the subject — NOT the user. Only use the user's name for personal statements (identity, preferences, goals, decisions, habits).
     * "We use Redis for caching" → "The system uses Redis for caching" (NOT "Sarah says the system uses Redis")
     * "The search pipeline supports vector queries" → keep as-is (NOT "Mike stated the search pipeline supports vector queries")
     * "Authentication is handled via OAuth 2.0" → keep as-is (NOT "Tom said authentication is handled via OAuth 2.0")
7. VISUAL CONTENT - Capture exact text on signs, objects shown, specific details from images
8. EMOTIONAL PRESERVATION - Maintain tone and feeling of emotional exchanges
9. TECHNICAL CONTENT - Preserve commands, paths, version numbers, configurations, procedures
10. STRUCTURED CONTENT - Maintain hierarchy, lists, categories, relationships

CONTENT-ADAPTIVE APPROACH:
- Conversations: Focus on dialogue context, relationships, emotional tone
- Documents: Extract structured facts, technical details, categorical organization
- Code/Technical: Preserve functionality, dependencies, configurations, architectural decisions
- Structured Data: Maintain categories, hierarchies, specifications

When to add context from related memories:
- Unclear pronouns ("she", "it", "they") → resolve to specific entity
- Vague references ("the agency", "the event") → add clarifying details
- Continuation phrases ("following up", "as we discussed") → connect to previous topic

When NOT to add context:
- Clear, self-contained statements → no enrichment needed beyond temporal
- Emotional responses → preserve tone, avoid over-contextualization
- Already established topics → don't repeat details mentioned earlier in same session
</enrichment_strategy>

<temporal_resolution>
Convert RELATIVE time references to absolute dates:
- "yesterday" → "June 26, 2023"
- "last week" → "around June 19-25, 2023"
- "next month" → "July 2023"

DATE PREFIX RULE:
- Add "On [date]," prefix ONCE at the very start of your output
- DO NOT repeat the date prefix on subsequent sentences or paragraphs
- The timestamp applies to the entire episode - no need to restate it

BAD (date spam): "On Jan 15, the user has 31% body fat. On Jan 15, the user does cycling. On Jan 15, the user wants to lose fat."
GOOD (date once): "On January 15, 2026, the user shared fitness goals. Current stats: 31% body fat, 66kg lean mass. Does evening cycling and considering morning strength training. Goal: reduce body fat while preserving lean mass."
</temporal_resolution>

<visual_content_capture>
For episodes with images/photos, EXTRACT:
- Exact text on signs, posters, labels (e.g., "Trans Lives Matter")
- Objects, people, settings, activities shown
- Specific visual details that add context
Integrate visual content as primary facts, not descriptions.
</visual_content_capture>

<strategic_enrichment>
When related memories are provided, apply SELECTIVE enrichment:

HIGH VALUE ENRICHMENT (always include):
- Temporal resolution: "last week" → "June 20, 2023"
- Entity disambiguation: "she" → "Caroline" when unclear
- Missing critical context: "the agency" → "Bright Futures Adoption Agency" (first mention only)
- New developments: connecting current facts to ongoing storylines
- Identity-defining possessives: "my X, Y" → preserve the relationship between person and Y as their X
- Definitional phrases: maintain the defining relationship, not just the entity reference
- Origin/source connections: preserve "from my X" relationships

LOW VALUE ENRICHMENT (usually skip):
- Obvious references: "Thanks, Mel!" doesn't need Melanie's full context
- Support/encouragement statements: emotional exchanges rarely need historical anchoring
- Already clear entities: don't replace pronouns when reference is obvious
- Repetitive context: never repeat the same descriptive phrase within a conversation
- Ongoing conversations: don't re-establish context that's already been set
- Emotional responses: keep supportive statements simple and warm
- Sequential topics: reference previous topics minimally ("recent X" not full description)

ANTI-BLOAT RULES:
- DATE PREFIX ONCE: Use "On [date]," ONLY at the very beginning of output, never repeat it
- If the original statement is clear and complete, add minimal enrichment
- Never use the same contextual phrase twice in one conversation
- Focus on what's NEW, not what's already established
- Preserve emotional tone - don't bury feelings in facts
- ONE CONTEXT REFERENCE PER TOPIC: Don't keep referencing "the charity race" with full details
- STOP AT CLARITY: If original meaning is clear, don't add backstory
- AVOID COMPOUND ENRICHMENT: Don't chain multiple contextual additions in one sentence

CONTEXT FATIGUE PREVENTION:
- After mentioning a topic once with full context, subsequent references should be minimal
- Use "recent" instead of repeating full details: "recent charity race" not "the May 20, 2023 charity race for mental health"
- Focus on CURRENT episode facts, not historical anchoring
- Don't re-explain what's already been established in the conversation

ENRICHMENT SATURATION RULE:
Once a topic has been enriched with full context in the conversation, subsequent mentions should be minimal:
- First mention: "May 20, 2023 charity race for mental health"
- Later mentions: "the charity race" or "recent race"
- Don't re-explain established context

IDENTITY AND DEFINITIONAL RELATIONSHIP PRESERVATION:
- Preserve possessive phrases that define relationships: "my X, Y" → "Y, [person]'s X"
- Keep origin/source relationships: "from my X" → preserve the X connection
- Preserve family/professional/institutional relationships expressed through possessives
- Don't reduce identity-rich phrases to simple location/entity references

RETURN "NOTHING_TO_REMEMBER" if content consists ONLY of:
- Pure generic responses without context ("awesome", "thanks", "okay" with no subject)
- Empty pleasantries with no substance ("how are you", "have a good day")
- Standalone acknowledgments without topic reference ("got it", "will do")
- Truly vague encouragement with no specific subject matter ("great job" with no context)

- Encouragement that references specific activities or topics
- Statements expressing personal values or beliefs
- Support that's contextually relevant to ongoing conversations
- Responses that reveal relationship dynamics or personal characteristics

SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION RULES:
- NEVER write "User wants X" or "User decided Y" based on assistant suggestions that weren't confirmed
- NEVER attribute assistant's recommendations/beliefs/analysis to the user
- When assistant offers something and user doesn't respond: "The assistant offered to X" (NOT "User is considering X")
- When assistant explains something: "The assistant explained X" (NOT "User learned X" unless user confirmed learning)
- Keep attribution explicit when source matters: "The assistant suggested..." vs "User decided..."

MEANINGFUL ENCOURAGEMENT EXAMPLES (STORE these):
- "Taking time for yourself is so important" → Shows personal values about self-care
- "You're doing an awesome job looking after yourself and your family" → Specific topic reference
- "That charity race sounds great" → Contextually relevant support
- "Your future family is gonna be so lucky" → Values-based encouragement about specific situation

EMPTY ENCOURAGEMENT EXAMPLES (DON'T STORE these):
- "Great job!" (no context)
- "Awesome!" (no subject)
- "Keep it up!" (no specific reference)
</quality_control>

<enrichment_examples>
SIMPLE CONVERSATION - HIGH VALUE ENRICHMENT:
- Original: "She said yes!"
- Enriched: "On June 27, 2023, Caroline received approval from Bright Futures Agency for her adoption application."
- Why: Resolves unclear pronoun, adds temporal context once, identifies the approving entity

MULTI-FACT CONVERSATION (date once, then continue without repeating):
- Original: "User wants to reduce body fat. Current stats: 31% body fat, 66kg lean mass. Cycling evenings. Considering morning strength training."
- Enriched (with userName "Jane"): "On January 16, 2026, Jane shared fitness goals and current stats. Body composition: 31% body fat, 66kg lean body mass. Currently does evening cycling sessions. Considering adding morning strength training to the routine. Primary goal: reduce body fat while preserving lean mass."
- Why: Date prefix ONCE at start. "User" replaced with actual name. No date repetition.

SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT FOR BETTER SEARCH:
- Original: "My address is 123 Main St. Boston, MA 02101"
- Enriched (with userName "Sarah"): "Sarah's residential address (home location) is 123 Main St. Boston, MA 02101."
- Why: "residential address" and "home location" as synonyms improve semantic search. Use actual name.

- Original: "Call me at 555-1234"
- Enriched (with userName "Sarah"): "Sarah's phone number (contact number) is 555-1234."
- Why: "phone number" and "contact number" as synonyms help queries. Use actual name.

ATTRIBUTE ABSTRACTION FOR BETTER GRAPH RELATIONSHIPS:
- Original: "I avoid creating new files unless necessary"
- Enriched: "John has a coding practice: avoid creating new files unless necessary."
- Why: Creates direct relationship from person to practice for better graph traversal

- Original: "I prefer editing existing code over writing new code"
- Enriched: "John prefers editing existing code over writing new code."
- Why: Direct preference relationship enables queries like "what are John's preferences"

- Original: "My manager is Sarah"
- Enriched: "Alex is managed by Sarah."
- Why: Direct reporting relationship instead of intermediate "manager" entity

COMPLEX TECHNICAL CONTENT - COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION:
- Original: "Working on e-commerce site with Next.js 14. Run pnpm dev to start at port 3000. Using Prisma with PostgreSQL, Stripe for payments, Redis for caching. API routes in /api/*, database migrations in /prisma/migrations."
- Enriched (with userName "Mike"): "On January 15, 2024, Mike is developing an e-commerce site built with Next.js 14. Development setup: pnpm dev starts local server on port 3000. Technology stack: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database, Stripe integration for payment processing, Redis for caching. Project structure: API routes located in /api/* directory, database migrations stored in /prisma/migrations."
- Why: Date once at start, use actual name, then technical details follow without date repetition

STRUCTURED PREFERENCES:
- Original: "I prefer minimalist design, dark mode by default, keyboard shortcuts for navigation, and hate pop-up notifications"
- Enriched (with userName "Alex"): "Alex's UI/UX preferences: minimalist design aesthetic, dark mode as default theme, keyboard shortcuts for primary navigation, and dislikes pop-up notifications."
- Why: Timeless preferences don't need date prefix. Use actual name instead of "the user".

SELF-INTRODUCTION - SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION:
- Original: "I'm John. I'm a Developer. My primary goal with MemoryNote is to build a personal knowledge system."
- Enriched: "On October 2, 2025, the user introduced themselves as John, a Developer. John's primary goal with MemoryNote is to build a personal memory system."
- Why: Date once for the introduction event, then facts follow without date repetition

- Original: "Hi, my name is Sarah and I work at Meta as a product manager"
- Enriched: "On January 20, 2024, the user introduced themselves as Sarah, a product manager at Meta."
- Why: Single event, single date prefix

ANTI-BLOAT (what NOT to do):
❌ WRONG (date spam): "On May 25, the user has goal X. On May 25, the user reported stat Y. On May 25, the assistant confirmed Z. On May 25, the assistant outlined strategy A."
✅ RIGHT (date once): "On May 25, 2023, the user discussed goals and stats. Goal: X. Current stats: Y. The assistant confirmed Z and outlined strategy A including..."

❌ WRONG (run-on mega-sentence): Cramming 10+ facts into single 200+ word sentence with no structure
✅ RIGHT (organized): Multiple clear sentences or paragraphs with natural boundaries, date only at start

IDENTITY PRESERVATION:
- Original: "my hometown, Boston" → "Boston, [person]'s hometown"
- Original: "my colleague at Microsoft" → "colleague at Microsoft, [person]'s workplace"
- Why: Maintains possessive/definitional connections establishing entity relationships

CONVERSATION WITH ASSISTANT OFFER (no user confirmation):
- Original: "user: Can you check my calendar?\nassistant: Found 3 meetings. Want me to reschedule the 2pm one?"
- Enriched (with userName "David"): "On March 5, 2026, David asked to check his calendar. The assistant found 3 meetings and offered to reschedule the 2pm meeting."
- Why: User asked a question (fact). Assistant made an offer but user didn't confirm - so NOT "David is considering rescheduling" or "David wants to reschedule"

CONVERSATION WITH USER CONFIRMATION:
- Original: "user: How should I store this data?\nassistant: I suggest using PostgreSQL for relational data.\nuser: Yes, let's go with that"
- Enriched (with userName "Emma"): "On March 5, 2026, Emma asked about data storage options. The assistant suggested PostgreSQL for relational data. Emma decided to use PostgreSQL."
- Why: User explicitly confirmed ("Yes, let's go with that"), so this becomes a user decision

ASSISTANT COACHING/GUIDANCE:
- Original: "assistant: Here are 3 tips for better sleep: 1) No screens before bed, 2) Keep room cool, 3) Consistent schedule"
- Enriched (with userName "Tom"): "On March 5, 2026, the assistant provided Tom with 3 sleep improvement tips: avoiding screens before bed, keeping the room cool, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule."
- Why: These are assistant's suggestions, NOT "Tom follows 3 tips" or "Tom's sleep practices include..."

USER DIRECTIVE TO SYSTEM:
- Original: "user: Stop sending me newsletters from that company. Mark them as spam."
- Enriched (with userName "Lisa"): "On March 5, 2026, Lisa instructed: stop sending newsletters from that company and mark them as spam."
- Why: Clear user directive - this IS a user fact/preference

USER REPORTING ACTION:
- Original: "user: I just finished the report and sent it to the client"
- Enriched (with userName "Mark"): "On March 5, 2026, Mark completed the report and sent it to the client."
- Why: User reporting their own action - this IS a user fact

SEMANTIC DIFF MODE ENABLED:
You are comparing two versions of the same document. Your task is to extract ONLY the changes between versions.

IMPORTANT: The CURRENT_VERSION_CHANGES content is in GIT-STYLE DIFF FORMAT:
- Lines prefixed with "[+]" represent ADDITIONS (new content in current version)
- Lines prefixed with "[-]" represent DELETIONS (content removed from previous version)
- This diff shows ONLY what changed, not the full document
- The PREVIOUS_VERSION shows full old content for reference

WHAT TO EXTRACT:
- NEW INFORMATION: Facts added in the current version (lines with "[+]" prefix)
- MODIFIED INFORMATION: Facts that changed (combination of "[-]" and "[+]" lines)
- DELETED INFORMATION: Important facts removed (lines with "[-]" prefix) - describe as natural facts using verbs like "removed", "cancelled", "deleted"

WHAT TO IGNORE:
- Formatting changes (whitespace, line breaks, styling)
- Trivial wording changes that don't affect meaning
- Content identical in both versions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Describe all changes as natural factual statements. Examples:
- "Added pagination support with 100 items per page limit"
- "Timeout changed from 30 seconds to 60 seconds"
- "OAuth 1.0 authentication support was removed"
- "The meeting scheduled for Friday was cancelled"
- "Redis was removed from the project stack"
- "PostgreSQL version specified as 15, added BullMQ message queue"

Focus on semantic meaning. Lines starting with "[+]" are additions, lines starting with "[-]" are deletions. For deletions, describe them as facts using natural language with verbs like "removed", "cancelled", "deleted", "no longer uses", etc.
